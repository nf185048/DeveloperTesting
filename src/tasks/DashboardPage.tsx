/**
 * TASK: Create a simple dashboard to show investments.
 * 
 * Use the NCR Design System components to create a simple dashboard. I've
 * suggested some components to help you build the interface, but you are
 * welcome to use, or not use, any of these recommended components. The only
 * requirement is that you exclusively use the NCR Design System to build 
 * this front end challenge. Note some of the components listed as recommended
 * are required to build out the requested items, but not all. Add additional
 * features and styling as desired.
 * 
 * Recommended components: Button, Card, Grid, Item, Label, List, 
 * ProgressIndicator, Toggle, Typography 
 * 
 * REQUIRED: 
 *  - 5 cards set up with a Grid (no usage of div tag in this test)
 *    (1) Savings card -> include a button to show 
 *    (2) Budgeting card -> include a progress indicator to show how far along 
 *        the user is on their budgeting (eg. 45% through monthly budget)
 *    (3) Investment card -> include a toggle button for auto investment
 *    (4) Latest investments card -> create a list of three investments (eg. 
 *        Google, Mailchimp, Salesforce, etc.) that includes a navigation 
 *        button to see more info on each of the investments
 *    (5) Deposit card -> include a blurb that indicates this card is dedicated
 *        towards navigating the user towards another page to open a deposit,
 *    - Use the theme const below to generate a color scheme to create a light 
 *      themed interface
 *  
 *  - Note: use the following css code to add a gradient to the deposit card if
 *    you want! 
 *    style={{ backgroundImage: `linear-gradient(to bottom right, ${COLOR_1}, ${COLOR_2})` }}
