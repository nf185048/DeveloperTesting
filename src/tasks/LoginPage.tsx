/**
 * TASK: Create a login interface.
 * 
 * Use the NCR Design System components to build a login modal. I've
 * suggested some components to help you build the interface, but you are
 * welcome to use, or not use, any of these recommended components. The only
 * requirement is that you exclusively use the NCR Design System to build 
 * this front end challenge. Note some of the components listed as recommended
 * are required to build out the requested items, but not all. Add additional
 * features and styling as desired.
 * 
 * Recommended components: Modal, Button, Grid, Input, InputWrapper, Typography
 * 
 * REQUIRED: 
 * - Username and password input spaces
 * - Login button
 * - Links for if user does not have an account or if they forgot password
 * - An alternative login options for login via Google or Facebook
